# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** December 2024

## Our Commitment

Nudge is built on a simple principle: **your data belongs to you**. We believe privacy is a fundamental right, not a feature to be traded for convenience.

## Data Collection

**Nudge collects zero data.** We do not collect, store, transmit, or process any user information whatsoever.

## What Stays on Your Device

All Nudge data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's built-in storage APIs:

- **Blocked Sites List** — Your custom list of domains to pause on
- **Settings** — Pause duration, unlock duration, theme preference
- **Statistics** — Temptations resisted and intentional visits counters
- **Session Data** — Temporary unlock timestamps (cleared automatically)

This data:
- Never leaves your device
- Is not accessible to us or any third party
- Is not transmitted over the internet
- Can be exported/imported by you at any time
- Is deleted when you uninstall the extension

## Network Activity

Nudge makes **zero network requests**. The extension:
- Does not connect to any servers
- Does not load remote resources
- Does not include analytics or telemetry
- Does not phone home for updates

## Third-Party Services

Nudge uses **no third-party services**:
- No analytics (Google Analytics, Mixpanel, etc.)
- No crash reporting (Sentry, Bugsnag, etc.)
- No advertising
- No A/B testing platforms

## Permissions Explained

Nudge requests the minimum permissions needed to function:

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `storage` | Save your settings and statistics locally |
| `alarms` | Clean up expired session unlocks |
| `tabs` | Close tabs when you click "Close Tab" |

We do not request permissions for:
- Browsing history
- Cookies
- Downloads
- Geolocation
- Microphone/Camera

## Chrome Sync

If you have Chrome Sync enabled, your Nudge settings may sync across your devices through Google's infrastructure. This is standard Chrome behavior for extension storage and is outside our control. To prevent this, disable Chrome Sync or use `storage.local` (contact us if you need this option).

## Open Source

Nudge is open source. You can audit every line of code at:
https://github.com/user/nudge

**TL;DR:** We don't collect anything. Everything stays on your device. We can't see your data because it never reaches us.
